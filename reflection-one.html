    <title> Reflection on "In Plato's Cave" from On Photography by Susan Sontag</title>

<p>The first thing that stood out to me from this reading was Sontag’s idea that previous forms of record, like writing or drawing or painting, were all inherently subjective. In every such piece, everything included was there because the author specifically chose to include it. While subjectivity exists in photography, there suddenly was the possibility for an actual objective representation of events, people, and places. While a photographer can choose to photograph one thing or another, whatever they end up taking a picture of inherently has to actually exist in the real world as it is presented in the photograph. I thought this was interesting because I had never considered just how fundamentally the introduction of photography changed so many fields, like history and journalism. As a journalism student in 2025, I think we take photography and its ability to be objective for granted, but it was really a huge innovation that increased the ability to trust in the media significantly. </p> 
<p>Her invocation of the Allegory of the Cave makes a lot of sense here given the type of innovation that photography was. While reading, I couldn’t help but think about the rise of generative AI platforms, specifically visual ones, and how that relates to all this. In my opinion the ability to create a completely artificial scene indistinguishable from a real photograph almost complete invalidates that objective quality of photography. It is as though we have returned to the media-reliability of the early 1800s; like generative AI put us right back in the cave. Who can really say that they can discern an AI generated image 100% of the time? There are still tells, but the rate at which the realism of these images has improved can’t be overstated. Reading her section on how photographs can induce moral outrage and shock, I can’t help but worry what bad actors can now cause people to feel under false pretenses with these tools. The trust that developed over the history of photography can now be horrendously taken advantage of. </p>
<p>At the end of the reading, Sontag writes “The limit of photographic knowledge of the world is that, while it can goad conscience, it can, finally, never be ethical or political knowledge.” I think this is an interesting idea that relates to both the previous ideas I reflected upon. Firstly, I think this shows that the objective quality of photography is only fully taken advantage of when used in conjunction with an older form of media, like writing, to give the image context. Secondly, I now think, because of AI, Sontag’s listed caveats are joined by many other types of knowledge photography now can no longer reliably be. One can no longer be sure that a photograph published online reflects any kind of physical truth or “historical” truth. Anyone now has the power to produce an image of anything or anyone anywhere at any time, and this seriously cheapens the medium of photography. I think the media landscape has only barely begun to feel the long term effects of this change, and they will likely be drastic. </p>
