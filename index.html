<p>Brooklyn based journalism student at Hunter College and filmmaker. I have 9 years experience with Photoshop and 8 years experience with Premiere Pro. I employ a lo-fi aesthetic in much of my art, often using antiquated tools and formats to achieve the desired feel. I'm inspired heavily by short filmmakers Claudio Caldini and Stan Brakhage, as well as the films Cabaret and Gummo.</p>
