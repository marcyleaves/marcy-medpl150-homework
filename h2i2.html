    <p>I cropped this to focus on what I thought was most interesting, which is the contrast between the lone natural shapes in the tree with the various straight lines and shapes from the buildings and manmade objects which are in frame. The unedited image felt a little flat, so I edited the tone, mainly adding some contrast.</p>
